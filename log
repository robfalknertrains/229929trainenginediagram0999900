Bad news for you
Without you noticing, about a few months ago I hacked into your computer an=
d started tracking your online activity.
I had no issue accessing your email.
Your password ?Pathetic. 


What's next?
After a week, I had already installed a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) [Learn more about this]  <https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what=-is-remote-access-trojan/> in all your devices.
In fact, it was not difficult at all (since you were visiting infected websites on which I have planted my malware).
It is very simple. This Trojan gives me access to all your devices (e.g. your microphone, webcam, keyboard and etc.)

[1] I uploaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers in a offshore location off your country's jurisdiction.
[2] I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contact list.
[3] My virus constantly updates its signature (it is driver-based), so it remains invisible to antivirus programs.

What should I worry?
In gathering information about you, I discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.
You really enjoy visiting porn sites, watching videos and pleasuring yourself.
Well, I managed to record some of your dirty scenes that show you masturbating.

If you think this is just a bluff, let me remind you: I have access to your entire life. I can see everything you do, hear everything you say, and read everything you type. Your privacy no longer exists.

What are you going to do?
I can make a few clicks and all your videos will be sent to your friends, colleagues and relatives.
I also don't mind putting them out in the public domain. I think you really don't want that, given the specifics of the videos you like to watch 
(you know exactly what I mean). It would lead to a real disaster for you.

Imagine this: Your boss, your family, your friends +WhatsApp full list- all of them will see these videos. Your reputation will be destroyed, and there will be no way to undo it.

Can we solve this problem?
Let's solve this problem this way:

You transfer me $500 (USD) (In Bitcoin equivalent at the exchange rate at the time of transfer),
and as soon as the transfer is received, I will immediately delete all these records, your data from my servers. After that we will forget about each other.
I also promise to deactivate and remove all malware from your devices and add your HWID (hardware ID) to a whitelist.

It's a fair deal, and the price is pretty low, considering that I've been recording all your actions and monitoring traffic for a long time.
In case you don't know how to buy and transfer Bitcoin, check out the section 'How can I buy Bitcoin? There are some useful links there.

You have 6 hours. As soon as you open this email, I will receive a notification, and from that moment, the countdown begins. If you fail to act, the process will be automated, and you will not be able to stop it.

What you should avoid:
[1] Do not try to email me (I sent this email from your mailbox. By the way
, it allows you to make sure that I am really telling the truth).
[2] Do not try to contact the police or other security services. Also, forget about telling your friends about it. 
If I discover this (as you can see it's not difficult, because I control all of your systems), your video will be immediately posted to the public.
[3] Do not try to find me - it makes absolutely no sense. All cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.
[4] Do not try to reinstall the OS on your devices or reset it. It is also pointless because all video, data and contacts are already stored on my remote servers.

What you don't have to worry about:

[1] That I will not be able to receive your money transfer.
Don't worry, I will immediately see the transaction as soon as you send it,
 because I constantly monitor all your actions (my Trojan has a remote control function, something like TeamViewer).

[2] That I will share your videos anyway after you send the funds.
Believe me, I don't see the point in making trouble for you. It's just business. If I really wanted to send your videos, I would have done it already.

[3] Getting infected again.
I will add your device ID and ip address to a whitelist that will remove any connections from your device or any devices in your household from getting infected.
