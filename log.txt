Hello,

________________________________

Bad news for you

Without you noticing, about a few months ago I hacked into your computer an=
d started tracking your online activity=2E
I had no issue accessing your email

Your password ?Pathetic=2E

What's next?

After a week, I had already installed a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) [Learn m=
ore about this]<https://www=2Echeckpoint=2Ecom/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/=
what-is-remote-access-trojan/> in all your devices=2E
In fact, it was not difficult at all (since you were visiting infected webs=
ites on which I have planted my malware)=2E
It is very simple=2E This Trojan gives me access to all your devices (e=2Eg=
=2E your microphone, webcam, keyboard and etc=2E)

[1] I uploaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to =
my servers in a offshore location off your country's jurisdiction=2E
[2] I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat his=
tory and contact list=2E
[3] My virus constantly updates its signature (it is driver-based), so it r=
emains invisible to antivirus programs=2E


What should I worry?

In gathering information about you, I discovered that you are a big fan of =
adult websites=2E
You really enjoy visiting porn sites, watching videos and pleasuring yourse=
lf=2E
Well, I managed to record some of your dirty scenes that show you masturbat=
ing=2E

If you think this is just a bluff, let me remind you: I have access to your=
 entire life=2E I can see everything you do, hear everything you say, and r=
ead everything you type=2E Your privacy no longer exists=2E


What are you going to do?

I can make a few clicks and all your videos will be sent to your friends, c=
olleagues and relatives=2E
I also don't mind putting them out in the public domain=2E I think you real=
ly don't want that, given the specifics of the videos you like to watch (yo=
u know exactly what I mean)=2E It would lead to a real disaster for you=2E

Imagine this: Your boss, your family, your friends +WhatsApp full list- all=
 of them will see these videos=2E Your reputation will be destroyed, and th=
ere will be no way to undo it=2E


Can we solve this problem?

Let's solve this problem this way:

You transfer me $500 (USD) (In Bitcoin at the exchange rate at the time of =
transfer), and as soon as the transfer is received, I will immediately dele=
te all these records, your data from my servers=2E After that we will forge=
t about each other=2E I also promise to deactivate and remove all malware f=
rom your devices=2E

It's a fair deal, and the price is pretty low, considering that I've been r=
ecording all your actions and monitoring traffic for a long time=2E
In case you don't know how to buy and transfer Bitcoin, check out the secti=
on 'How can I buy Bitcoin? There are some useful links there=2E

You have 6 hours=2E As soon as you open this email, I will receive a notifi=
cation, and from that moment, the countdown begins=2E If you fail to act, t=
he process will beautomated, and you will not be able to stop it=2E

How can I buy Bitcoin?

Check out this sites:

[1] www=2Ecoinbase=2Ecom/how-to-buy/bitcoin<https://www=2Ecoinbase=2Ecom/ho=
w-to-buy/bitcoin>
[2] www=2Ebinance=2Ecom/en-NG/buy-Bitcoin<https://www=2Ebinance=2Ecom/en-NG=
/buy-Bitcoin>
[3] www=2Ekraken=2Ecom/learn/buy-bitcoin-btc<https://www=2Ekraken=2Ecom/lea=
rn/buy-bitcoin-btc>


What you should avoid:

[1] Do not try to email me (I sent this email from your mailbox=2E By the w=
ay, it allows you to make sure that I am really telling the truth)=2E
[2] Do not try to contact the police or other security services=2E Also, fo=
rget about telling your friends about it=2E If I discover this (as you can =
see, it's not difficult, because I control all of your systems), your video=
 will be immediately posted to the public=2E
[3] Do not try to find me - it makes absolutely no sense=2E All cryptocurre=
ncy transactions are anonymous=2E
[4] Do not try to reinstall the OS on your devices or reset it=2E It is als=
o pointless because all video, data and contacts are already stored on my r=
emote servers=2E


What you don't have to worry about:


[1] That I will not be able to receive your money transfer=2E

Don't worry, I will immediately see the transaction as soon as you send it,=
 because I constantly monitor all your actions (my Trojan has a remote cont=
rol function, something like TeamViewer)=2E


[2] That I will share your videos anyway after you send the funds=2E

Believe me, I don't see the point in making trouble for you=2E It's just bu=
siness=2E If I really wanted to send your videos, I would have done it alre=
ady=2E

After payment i will add a whitelist against your IP address and hardware I=
D so you will never be the victim of this attack again=2E
